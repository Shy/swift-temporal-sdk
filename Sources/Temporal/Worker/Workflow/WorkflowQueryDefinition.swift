/// A protocol for defining Temporal workflow queries.
///
/// Workflow queries provide a way to synchronously retrieve information from a running workflow
/// without affecting its execution. Queries are read-only operations that can inspect the
/// current state of a workflow and return data to the caller.
///
/// ## Key Characteristics
///
/// - **Read-only**: Queries cannot modify workflow state or trigger side effects
/// - **Synchronous**: Queries return results immediately without workflow progression
/// - **Deterministic**: Query implementations must be deterministic and replay-safe
/// - **Stateless**: Queries should not depend on external state
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// @Workflow
/// final class OrderProcessingWorkflow {
///     var currentStatus = "pending"
///
///     func run(input: OrderInput) async throws -> Void {
///         currentStatus = "processing"
///         // Process order logic
///         try await processOrder()
///         currentStatus = "finished"
///     }
///
///     @WorkflowQuery
///     func getOrderStatus() throws -> String {
///         return currentStatus
///     }
/// }
/// ```
public protocol WorkflowQueryDefinition<Workflow>: _SendableMetaTypeBaseProtocol, Sendable {
    /// The input type for the query.
    associatedtype Input: Sendable

    /// The output type returned by the query.
    associatedtype Output: Sendable

    /// The workflow type that this query can be applied to.
    ///
    /// This establishes the relationship between the query and its target workflow.
    associatedtype Workflow: WorkflowDefinition

    /// The query name used for identification and routing.
    ///
    /// This identifier is used by Temporal to route query requests to the appropriate implementation.
    /// Defaults to the string representation of the conforming type.
    static var name: String { get }

    /// An optional description of the query's purpose.
    ///
    /// This description may appear in user interfaces and tooling to help
    /// users understand the query's functionality. Defaults to `nil`.
    static var description: String? { get }

    /// Executes the query and returns the requested information.
    ///
    /// This method is called when a query request is received for the workflow.
    /// Use ``Workflow`` to access the workflow execution context.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - workflow: The workflow instance being queried.
    ///   - input: The input data for the query.
    /// - Returns: The query result.
    /// - Throws: Any error that occurs during query processing.
